## [Prerelease] - Unreleased


## [v0.8.0] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- Added support for taking snapshots of memory using `LoadedWasmSandbox::snapshot`. A snapshot can be used to restore the memory state of the LoadedWasmSandbox to a specific point in time, using `LoadedWasmSandbox::restore`.

### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** `LoadedWasmSandbox::call_guest_function` no longer resets sandbox memory after the guest function call. If this old behavior is desired, manually call `LoadedWasmSandbox::snapshot` to take a snapshot of memory before calling guest function, and use `LoadedWasmSandbox::restore` after invoking the function.
- Updated to wasmtime v35.0.0

## [v0.7.0] - 2054-07-03
